A small project for MIC Transformer. Ace-Game is simple animated deck of cards, created using react.js, [React Simple Animate](https://github.com/bluebill1049/react-simple-animate) and [Deck of Cards API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/). 

## URL

## Known Issue

First time card drawing may notice some delay since the images are being pulled by the API and rendering in real time. Draw all the cards, refresh the page and try again for a smoother experience.
